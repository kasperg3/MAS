explorers:
	- communicates with other explorers for better coverage
	- Request available transporter withing transmission range 
	- Make transporters/explorers use the closest base
	- If an available transporter is within range transmit the X most recent seen ores
	- X amount seen ore before informing base, timeout: dont explore for too long time with valuable infomation
	- shrink/expand perception field if another explorer is nearby
	- Shrink/Expand when closer to the base
	- Don't move all the way to the base, use coms
	- Breadcrumbs when seeing a ore, when already have coordinate stored 
	- Store covered coordinates
	- The less energy a robot has less desire to move away from the closest base 

Transporter:
	- Occationally perception
	- Make transporters explore when no requests are available
	- Make transporters follow when no requests are available
	- Make transporters Roam when no requests are available
	- Transmit in local neighbourhood if depleting a ore or not 
	- communicates with other explorers for better coverage

Base:
	- Coorperative?

Q:
	- Storage of coordinates, is the base coordinate counted as memory usage (S < (X + Y + N))

LOW ENERGY METRIC:
	- Half the distance of the map
	- The shortest distance to the base + a safety factor
